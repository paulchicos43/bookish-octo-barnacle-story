Once upon a time, there was a man in a far away desert. He did not have any
water or food. But, at least he had wifi. He was able to make kickstarter
online and raise money for food. But, he had nowhere to spend the money!
Where was he to spend all this money and could he call for help using the
wifi! And, his name was bob.
Bob searched for help on the Internet. He found a website called "Search & 
Rescue: World". He browsed the website and found out that this website allowed
him to request a rescue by filling out an online form. Natually, Bob tried to 
fill out the form so that he could be saved. As he clicked on the link to the
form, a window popped up asking to create an account. Since he had an email, 
he was able to create the account. However, when he tried to log in, the worst
thing possible happened-Duo Factor Authentification

Bob recalled that he traded his Supreme x iPhone 18 Pro Max Plus in the last town
for some food and water and an iPhone 4, which is the thing he was holding on his 
hand right now. But without the original Supreme x iPhone 18 Pro Max Plus, he couldnt
receive his Duo-Factor Authentification. While kept missing his fancy Supreme x iPhone
18 Pro Max Plus and cursing the Duo app, he decided to go back to the town. 

Bob went back to town. He was so eagerly to past his Duo authentification that he lost all 
his money on the way! He traversed every house in the town in a level-order, buying
every iphone he sees! Now he has no money, but he still could not pass the DUO MULTIFACTOR
AUTHENTIFICATION anyway!
